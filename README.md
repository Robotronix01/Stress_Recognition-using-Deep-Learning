Stress_Recognition-using-Deep-Learning.

   Identify the stress from facial expression.
   
 Data Description.
 
  With the FER 2013 dataset we created three broad categories of stressed, happy and neutral.

Explaination.

  We are using the approach of Transfer Learning to make a highly customized model perfect for our dataset and usage for best accuracy possible with limitation of real     time analysis in our hand. Transfer learning will allow us to have backbone pre-trained models like (ResNet50, ResNet101, InceptionV2, InceptionV3, etc.)
